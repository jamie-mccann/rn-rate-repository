# Rate Repository App

A react-native application following the awesome
[tutorial](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10/introduction_to_react_native)
from full stack open.

## Some alterations

This version of rate-repository will use typescript. I would also like to try a
different library for forms called
[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) as well as a lightweight library
for state management called [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), if
possible.

Additionally, this is using react-native-paper and react-navigation for the AppBar
and moving between screens.
